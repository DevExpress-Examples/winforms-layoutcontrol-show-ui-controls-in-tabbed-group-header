' How to place controls in a LayoutControl's tabbed group header
' 
' By default, it is not possible to place any control within a tabbed group
' header, because the LayoutControl's layout can be widely customized (groups can
' be moved and hidden, their direction can be changed). However, you can emulate
' controls by custom drawing them. This example demonstrates how to draw a
' CheckBox and ProgressBar in headers.
